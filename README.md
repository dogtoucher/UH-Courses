Main repository for some course content at University of Helsinki (selected by personal interests).

I am studying Theoritical and Computational Methods at University of Helsinki as my second Master's degree. I have already got a Bachelor's in Chemistry and a Master's degree in Quantum/Computational Chemistry.

It's the most flexible programme I have ever seen in most of the universities for its no specific study track with all possibility to choose any course from natural science and CS/DS(with sufficient motivation of course). Considering personal background, I decide to choose courses mainly from computer science and data science tracks with some other courses I might interest.

At first I try various of note apps and methods, but I have to say the git-markdown-(html pages) may be the best choice.
